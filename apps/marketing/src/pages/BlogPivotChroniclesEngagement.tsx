            After learning from Extenure, I thought I'd figured it out.<br />
            Retention wasn't the problem. Engagement was.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            If we could measure how engaged employees felt, we could help managers take action before people started looking for the exit.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8">
            So we built engagement analytics: pulse surveys, sentiment tracking, engagement scores by team and location.<br />
            Beautiful dashboards. Real-time alerts. Trend analysis.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 font-semibold text-gray-900">
            And once again, nobody cared.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
            The Pattern I Didn't See
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            I was so focused on finding the "right" problem that I missed the bigger issue: I kept building the same solution.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Extenure: analytics dashboard.<br />
            Engagement platform: analytics dashboard.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Different data, same format. Same promise: "Know what's happening so you can fix it."
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8">
            I was competing with 50 other dashboards managers already had: scheduling, payroll, inventory, sales, labor costs, compliance reports. One more chart wasn't going to change their day.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
            The Engagement Survey Graveyard
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            I pitched to an HR director at a multi-location restaurant chain. She listened politely, then said:
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-600 pl-6 my-8 text-xl text-gray-700 italic">
            "We already do quarterly engagement surveys. The scores sit in a spreadsheet. Nobody looks at them unless something's on fire."
          </blockquote>

          <p className="mb-6">
            I tried to explain how our platform was different: real-time, actionable, manager-focused.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8">
            She cut me off: "That's what the last three vendors said too."
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
            The Abstraction Problem
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Engagement is too abstract to sell.<br />
            What does a "67% engagement score" mean? What do you do about it?
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            I thought we'd solved this with our action recommendations:
          </p>

          <ul className="mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>"Schedule more one-on-ones"</li>
            <li>"Recognize top performers publicly"</li>
            <li>"Review workload distribution"</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-6">
            But these felt generic because they were. Real engagement issues are messy and specific: personality conflicts, unfair scheduling, broken equipment, unclear expectations.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8">
            A dashboard can't fix those. A conversation can.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
            What I Should Have Built
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Instead of measuring engagement, we should have built tools that created it:
          </p>

          <ul className="mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Structured check-in templates that managers could actually use</li>
            <li>Recognition systems that felt genuine, not automated</li>
            <li>Career pathway visualizations employees could explore themselves</li>
            <li>Feedback mechanisms that led to real changes, not just data collection</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-8">
            But I was still in love with analytics. I wanted elegant data models, not messy human interactions.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
            The Dashboard Grind
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-6">
            I spent weeks perfecting the engagement dashboard:<br />
            Drag-and-drop widgets. Custom date ranges. Exportable reports. Mobile responsive.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            I thought polish would matter.<br />
            I thought if it looked professional enough, felt intuitive enough, loaded fast enough, people would use it.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8">
            They didn't. Because the problem wasn't that engagement tools were poorly designed.<br />
            The problem was that engagement was already being tracked everywhere, and nothing was changing.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
            The Sales Cycle That Never Closed
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Every pitch followed the same pattern:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Week 1:</strong> "This is interesting, let me think about it."
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Week 2:</strong> "Can you send me pricing?"
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Week 3:</strong> "I need to talk to my team."
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            <strong>Week 4:</strong> Ghost.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            I told myself they just needed more education, more case studies, more proof points.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8">
            The truth: they didn't have the problem I was solving.<br />
            Or they did, but a dashboard wasn't going to fix it.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
            What I Learned (This Time)

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Changing the data ≠ changing the solution.</strong> If you keep building dashboards, you're not pivoting.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Abstract problems don't convert.</strong> "Improve engagement" sounds important but doesn't drive urgency.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Survey fatigue is real.</strong> People don't want more measurement. They want less friction.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Polish doesn't overcome indifference.</strong> A beautiful dashboard that nobody needs is still useless.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-0">
              <strong>If every pitch ends the same way, the problem isn't the pitch.</strong> It's the product.

          <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
            So we pivoted again.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 text-lg">
            This time, to something tangible: health code violations, safety issues, cleanliness standards.<br />
            Things you could see, point to, and fix.
