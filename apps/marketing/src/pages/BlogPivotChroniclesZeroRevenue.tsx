            The Comfort of "Almost"
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            For months, I kept saying things like,
          </p>

          <ul className="mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>"We're close."</li>
            <li>"Just need a few more features."</li>
            <li>"We're almost there."</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-8">
            But "almost" became a way to protect my ego.<br />
            As long as the product wasn't done, I didn't have to test whether anyone actually wanted it.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            When you're in that phase, you can tell yourself anything.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8">
            You can point to code commits, new designs, cleaner architecture—all progress that feels real.<br />
            But until someone pays, it's not validation—it's rehearsal.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 font-semibold text-gray-900">
            I was confusing effort with evidence.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
            The Mirror That Revenue Holds Up
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Revenue is brutally honest.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8">
            It tells you whether your product actually solves a problem painful enough for someone to part with money.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8">
            It doesn't care how many hours you've spent, how elegant your stack is, or how "cool" the idea sounds on LinkedIn.<br />
            Revenue is the only external signal that cuts through founder delusion.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 my-8">
            <p className="mb-2 text-gray-900">
              $0 tells you you're still guessing.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-0 font-semibold text-gray-900">
              And that's valuable—because guessing is the stage where you can still change everything.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
            The Hardest Part Isn't Building
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            The hardest part is picking up the phone.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8">
            It's sending the message, having the awkward conversation, hearing the lukewarm "maybe later."
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            You tell yourself you're being strategic by waiting—but really, you're being protective.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8">
            Building shields you from rejection. Selling exposes you to it.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 font-semibold text-gray-900">
            I learned that every hour I spent coding instead of talking to customers was just avoidance wearing productivity's clothes.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
            What $0 Taught Me
          </h2>

          <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-600 p-6 my-8">
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Activity ≠ traction.</strong> Code, designs, docs—they're not progress until they touch a customer.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Silence is feedback.</strong> If no one's asking for it, that's a signal—not bad luck.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Validation starts with conversation, not code.</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="mb-0">
              <strong>Selling early is scary—but so is wasting a year building alone.</strong>
            </p>
          </div>

          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            $0 in revenue doesn't mean failure.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
            It means you've stripped away the illusions.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
            It's the purest mirror you'll ever get as a founder.<br />
            And once you face it honestly, you can finally start building something people actually want.
          </p>
